Welcome to apocalyptech's Github Pages root.

There's really not much here, and I don't intend to host much in the future.
My main website, [apocalyptech.com](https://apocalyptech.com) is where I
put most of my stuff, and other stuff can be found just via my
[github projects area](https://github.com/apocalyptech).

I put this up because I *did* put up one Github Pages based site for a
project, though, so I wanted a master index here to link to that (plus
anything else I setup here in the future).  So, here's what there is:

* [Borderlands 3 Cosmetics Galleries](/bl3cosmetics/)

That's it!  Enjoy, or not.
